Player data is 84 bytes long (Padded by 2 zero bytes at the end)
Starts at B288 with Duane Starks (original Base Franchise save).

Name pointer formula looks like: 
stringLocation = pointerAddress + pointerFalue -1;

Looks like 2317 total players in the save file.

Desired Features:
1. Read all player and deam data from gamesave to Text *
2. Apply Text (in proper format) to gamesave *
3. Change Team Playbooks
4. Change team defensive formations (Auto update based on player on roster?)
5. Assign default Jerseys ?
6. Quick view of a player's apperance (GUI where arrow buttons go to the next player)
7. Auto update Depth chart
8. Search text in text area *
9. Set Coach data

Player Data:
0x54 bytes (84 bytes)
bytes 0- 37 seem to be all appearance related.
bytes 38-52 ??? (41 appears relavent to depth chart)
bytes 53-81, seem to all be skill related
