Player data is 84 bytes long (Padded by 2 zero bytes at the end)
Starts at B288 with Duane Starks (original Base Franchise save).

Name pointer formula looks like: 
stringLocation = pointerAddress + pointerFalue -1;

Signature is actually stored in file called "EXTRA". 
It is hashed with the SAVEGAME.DAT file and the 2k5 key.
changing the Save file name in "SaveMeta.xbx" causes roster to look corrupted when trying to load.

Looks like 2317 total players in the base franchise save file.

Desired Features:
1. Read all player and deam tata from gamesave to Text *
2. Apply Text (in proper format) to gamesave *
3. Change Team Playbooks

8. Search text in text area *
9. Set Coach data

====================== Face info ===========================
The player's model face texture is controlled by 3 things.
  1. Photo
  2. Face
  3. Skin

Many of the players from the 2004 base roster have unique face textures applied to the player models in-game.
This association is done through 'Photo ID'.
If there is not a unique texture related to the player's 'Photo ID', then a generic face is used.
The generic face is a combination of Face and skin. There are only 42 Generic faces.
