Player data is 84 bytes long (Padded by 2 zero bytes at the end)
Starts at B288 with Duane Starks (original Base Franchise save).

Name pointer formula looks like: 
stringLocation = pointerAddress + pointerFalue -1;

Signature is actually stored in file called "EXTRA". 
It is hashed with the SAVEGAME.DAT file and the 2k5 key.
changing the Save file name in "SaveMeta.xbx" causes roster to look corrupted when trying to load.

Looks like 2317 total players in the base franchise save file.

Desired Features:
1. Read all player and deam data from gamesave to Text *
2. Apply Text (in proper format) to gamesave *
3. Change Team Playbooks
4. Change team defensive formations (Auto update based on player on roster?)
5. Assign default Jerseys ?
6. Quick view of a player's apperance (GUI where arrow buttons go to the next player)
7. Auto update Depth chart
8. Search text in text area *
9. Set Coach data
