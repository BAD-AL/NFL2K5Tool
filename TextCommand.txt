The following 'commands' can be used to change the order in which attributes are displayed:
	Key 
	CoachKEY
	
The following command can be used to apply arbitraty edits which would normally be 
applied with a hex editor:
	SET


The following commands can be processed to perform common operations instead of having to run them from
the menus.

Modification Commands:
	LookupAndModify
	AutoUpdateDepthChart
	AutoUpdatePBP
	AutoUpdatePhoto
	ApplyFormula(<arguments>)

	
Note: 
To Apply Data without saving to the gamesave file.
Use:
 File -> Apply Data without saving 

This will update the gamesave file in-memory, but won't save to a file. (sometimes useful)
I like to use this feature when appling multiple sets of data to a gamesave file.


====== Key ======
To change the displayed attributes of players listed you can set the 'Key' to list
only the attributes you wish to see.
This will also apply when setting player data.

Example:
	Key=Position,fname,lname,Photo,Skin


To reset the key to default use:
	<clear text content>
	type/paste into text area:
	Key=
	<apply data without saving >

Note: 
	The player Gui only works with the default Key 
	
====== CoachKEY ======
Similar in functionality as 'Key', only for Coaches 



====== SET ======
Sets data in the gamesave 

Example:
	#"St. Louis" -> "L.A.     "
	SET(0x7633e,0x4C002E0041002E0020002000200020002000)
	SET(0x79898,0x4C002E0041002E0020002000200020002000)

In the above example the intent is to set the string "St. Louis" to "L.A.     ".
The locations of strings changes with each gamesave file. You can find string and their 
locations in the DebugDialog.


====== LookupAndModify ======
If we wish to modify player data without specifying all the data we can use this feature.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with the 'Key' command.
The 'Position','fname' and 'lname' attributes must be specified for player lookup.

Example:
	LookupAndModify
	Key= Position,fname,lname,Photo
	QB,Jimmy,Garoppolo,0481,
	QB,Nick,Mullens,0799,
	RB,Tevin,Coleman,0187,
	RB,Matt,Breida,0242,

The above example will lookup the specified players and set their photo the the one specified.

====== AutoUpdateDepthChart ======
Simple command that will update the depth chart according to player occurance in the gamesave.
So for QB, the first QB to occur on a roster will become the starter, the 2nd QB to occur will
become 2nd string the 3rd QB to occur will become 3rd string on the depth chart.
Same for the other positions too.

Example:
	<clear data>
	type/paste into text area:
	AutoUpdateDepthChart
	<apply data without saving>

====== AutoUpdatePBP ======
The "PBP" stands for 'Play by play' name used by the commentators in the game.
So for all the players with the last name 'Smith', the 'Smith' name will be mentioned
by the commentators when they talk about the player.
The name to pbp mappings are stored in 'PlayerData\ENFNameIndex.txt'

Example:
	<clear data>
	type/paste into text area :
	AutoUpdatePBP
	<apply data without saving>

====== AutoUpdatePhoto ======
Updates the player photos according to their names.
Name file is located at 'PlayerData\ENFPhotoIndex.txt'.

Example:
	<clear data>
	type/paste into text area :
	AutoUpdatePhoto
	<apply data without saving>

====== ApplyFormula ======
Can be used to modify players meeting specified attributes.
The 'Global Edit Form' Can be used to craft and apply formulas.
The formulas will print to the console when they are run from the 
Global edit form so you can more easily see/create/use/re-use them.

Basic syntax:
	ApplyFormula(<formula>, <target attribute>, < target value>, [positions], <Mode (optional)>)

Examples:
	# For all kickers, punters or quarterbacks who have a white turtleneck, take away 1 speed point
	ApplyFormula('Turtleneck = White','Speed',-1, [K,P,QB], Add)
	
	# For all quarterbacks who wear a RightGlove, set their RightGlove to 'None'
	ApplyFormula('RightGlove <> None','RightGlove','None', [QB])
	
	# For all quarterbacks who have speed greater than 80, set their 'Stamana' to 95% of what it currently is
	ApplyFormula('Speed > 80','Stamina',95, [QB], Percent)
	
	# For all kickers and punters, set their stanama to '95' 
	ApplyFormula('Always','Stamina',95, [K,P])
